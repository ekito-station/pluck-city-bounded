# Pluck City -bounded-
"Pluck City" is an Audio AR work that plays sounds by plucking AR strings stretched across space. 
"Pluck City -bounded-" is developed from "Pluck City -harmonized-" and dedicated to urban-scale experiences.

When you shoot an AR ball toward a building, a string is stretched to connect the point where you are and the point of collision between the ball and the building. 
When the reflected ball hits another building, a new string is stretched between the previous and new collision points, creating a series of strings.
A sound is played as you approach one string, followed by a sound from the next string. 
A melody is played from a series of strings.

PLATEAU's 3D city models and Geospatial API are utilized for collision detection of balls and buildings.

## Requirement
- Unity 2020.3.30f1
